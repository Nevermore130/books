There's a big **new finding** in the new AP NORC Center for **public affairs poll**. Neither candidate has a **decisive edge** on the economy.

About 4 in 10 say Donald Trump would be better on the economy. about 4 in 10 say Harris would be better on the economy .Both 

candidates approach(对付，处理) this issue differently.



The first of these was to do with medical costs. or more sepecifically, how to lower them.

Here, Harris wants to accelerate and expand a Biden administration effort allowing Medicare and other federal(/ ˈfedərəl /) programs to negotiate(/ nɪˈɡoʊʃieɪt / 谈判协商) with drug makers to lower the cost of  prescription medication.
