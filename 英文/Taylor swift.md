First day, We've been in the same room.(这是我们第一天共处一室)

That's so weird.

I think when lockdown(/'la:kdaun/) happened. (当隔离发生的时候)

I just found myself completely listless(无精打采的) and purposeless(无目的，无意义的) and ...()

And I'd come to The National show and afterward(后来) you would come up(接近)  and talk to me ,and you were so nice.

I was like ,"How do you guys write songs?"  



You were like , "We all live in different places, so sometimes I'll just make tracks and send them around and send them to Matt"

tracks: a piece of music or song on a record, tape or CD.

I just kind of thought to myself （think to myself 心里想）



``` 
kind of 時，聽起來會帶有一種比較籠統、模糊的感覺

明確 ▶️  You’re rude.
你這樣很失禮。

籠統 ▶️  You’re kind of rude.
你這樣算滿失禮的
```

If ever there was(加强语气，确实) an opportunity to work with someone  I  was such a fan of ，that would be so cool.
