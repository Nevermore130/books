And so another Friday night in Manhattan crept(creep 过去式) towards dawn（/ dɑːn / 黎明）.

towards: closer to a point in time

And just when I thought I would have to do the unspeakable(难以形容)..... walk home.

And just when I thought I'd lost everything, i found a face, One face which i can always read love.

And just when I thought （我以为）

Where can i drop you ? 你要在哪下车

Can you drop me near the bank? (可以让我在银行附近下车吗)



So What have you been doing lately ? (最近都在忙什么)

How have you been ? （最近怎么样）

You mean besides going out every night?   (你是说除了每天晚上鬼混之外吗)

Yeah. I mean, what do you do for work ? 

I'm sort of a sexual(/ ˈsekʃuəl /) anthropologist(/ ˌænθrəˈpɑːlədʒɪst /  人类学家)  

You mean like a hooker(妓女) ?

No I write a column called "Sex and the City"  (我写了欲望都市的专栏)

You've never been in love . (你从未坠入爱河过)

I felt the wind(/ wɪnd /) knocked out of me . ( 感到一阵眩晕)

I wanted to crawl under the covers and go right to sleep  

* go right to (立刻马上)
* crawl ： / krɔːl /  爬行，匍匐前进；缓慢移动

Thanks for the ride (谢谢让我搭便车)

Anytime

Have you ever been in love?   Abso-fuckin'-lutely.
