A company's [financial statements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp)—[balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp), [income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp), and [cash flow statements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp)—are a key source of data for analyzing the investment value of its stock.

### The Structure of a Balance Sheet  ###

A company's balance sheet is comprised of [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp), [liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp), and [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp). Assets represent things of value that a company owns and has in its possession(/ pəˈzeʃn /  拥有，持有；个人财产), or something that will be received and can be measured objectively(客观地)

Liabilities are what a company owes to others—creditors（债权人，贷方） suppliers（/ səˈplaɪərz / 供应商）, tax authorities（/ əˈθɔːrətiz / 当局，官方；官方机构）, employees, etc. They are obligations（/ ˌɑːblɪˈɡeɪʃnz / 义务；债务） that must be paid under certain conditions and time frames.

负债是公司欠其他人（债权人、供应商、税务机关、员工等）的债务。它们是必须在特定条件和时间范围内支付的义务。

A company's equity represents retained earnings（留存收益） and funds contributed by its [shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp), who accept the uncertainty that comes with ownership risk in exchange for what they hope will be a good [return on their investment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp#axzz1lc9Gduoi).

The relationship of these items is expressed in the fundamental balance sheet equation:

```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

The meaning of this equation is important. Generally, sales growth, whether rapid(/ ˈræpɪd / 快的，迅速的) or slow, dictates(/ ˈdɪkteɪt / 影响，支配；) a larger [asset base](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-base.asp)—higher levels of inventory, [receivables](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp), and [fixed assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp) ([plant, property, and equipment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppe.asp)). As a company's assets grow, its liabilities and/or equity also tend to grow(倾向于生长) in order for its financial position to stay in balance.

这个等式的意义很重要。一般来说，销售增长，无论是快还是慢，都意味着更大的资产基础——更高水平的库存、应收账款和固定资产（厂房、财产和设备）。随着公司资产的增长，其负债和/或权益也往往会增长，以使其财务状况保持平衡。

### What Are Current Assets? ###

The Current Assets account is a balance sheet line item listed under the Assets section, which accounts for all company-owned assets that can be converted to cash within one year.

流动资产账户是资产负债表资产部分下列出的行项目，它记录了公司拥有的所有可以在一年内转换为现金的资产。

Current assets include [cash](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash.asp), cash equivalents（/ ɪˈkwɪvələnts / 同等设备；等同物）, [accounts receivable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp), stock inventory, marketable securities（/ sɪˈkjʊrətiz / 有价证券；担保；抵押物）, pre-paid liabilities, and other [liquid assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp).

流动资产包括现金、现金等价物、应收账款、存货、有价证券、预付负债和其他流动资产。



This section is important for investors because it shows the company's short-term liquidity. According to Apple's balance sheet for fiscal year 2023, it had $143 million in the Current Assets account it could convert to cash within one year.

Apple, Inc. "[Form 10-K for Fiscal Year 2023](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000320193/faab4555-c69b-438a-aaf7-e09305f87ca3.pdf)."

 This short-term liquidity is vital—if Apple were to experience issues paying its short-term obligations, it could liquidate（/ ˈlɪkwɪdeɪt / 清算；偿付） these assets to help cover these debts.

这种短期流动性至关重要——如果苹果在支付短期债务方面遇到问题，它可以清算这些资产以帮助偿还这些债务。

### Types of Current Assets ###

* Cash and Cash Equivalents
* Marketable Securities
* Accounts Receivable
* Inventory
* Prepaid Liabilities/Expenses



### Cash and Cash Equivalents

By definition, assets in the Current Assets account are cash or can be quickly converted to cash. Cash equivalents are certificates of deposit（/ dɪˈpɑːzɪt / 存款，订金；押金）, money market funds, short-term government bonds, and treasury（/ ˈtreʒəri / 财政部） bills.

To qualify（/ ˈkwɑːlɪfaɪ / 有权去做，取得资格） as current assets, these items must not have any restrictions（限制） that inhibit their short-term liquidity.

根据定义，流动资产账户中的资产是现金或可以快速转换为现金的资产。现金等价物包括存款证、货币市场基金、短期政府债券和国库券。

为了符合流动资产的资格，这些项目不得有任何抑制其短期流动性的限制。

### Marketable Securities

Marketable Securities is the account where the total value of liquid investments that can be quickly converted to cash without reducing their market value is entered

有价证券是指输入可以快速转换为现金而不降低其市场价值的流动投资总价值的账户

 For example, if shares of a company trade in very low volumes（/ ˈvɑːljəmz / 体积，容量）, it may not be possible to convert them to cash without impacting their market value. These shares would not be considered liquid and, therefore, would not have their value entered into the Current Assets account.

如果一家公司的股票交易量非常低，则可能无法在不影响其市场价值的情况下将其转换为现金。这些股份不被视为具有流动性，因此其价值不会进入流动资产账户。

### Accounts Receivable

Accounts Receivable—the value of all money due to a company for goods or services delivered（/ dɪˈlɪvərd / 投递，运送；履行，兑现；交付） or used but not yet paid for by customers—is entered in Current Assets as long as the accounts can be expected to be paid within a year.

 If a business makes sales by offering longer credit terms to its customers, some of its receivables may not be included in the Current Assets account.

应收账款——公司因交付或使用但尚未由客户支付的商品或服务而应得的所有款项的价值——只要预计可在一年内支付，就应记入流动资产。如果企业通过向客户提供较长信用期限来进行销售，则其部分应收账款可能不会包含在流动资产账户中。



### Inventory（存货）

Inventory—which represents raw materials, components, and finished products—is included in the Current Assets account

For example, there is little or no guarantee that a dozen units of high-cost heavy earth-moving equipment（设备，用具） may be sold over the next year, but there is a relatively high chance of a successful sale of a thousand umbrellas in the coming rainy season.

例如，几乎不能保证明年能卖出十几台高成本的重型土方设备，但在即将到来的雨季成功销售一千把雨伞的机会相对较高。

For these reasons, you should view inventory with a skeptical（/ ˈskeptɪk(ə)l / 持怀疑态度的） eye. Read through the company reports or browse（/ braʊz /） the internet to determine(/ dɪˈtɜːrmɪn /) what is going on with a company's inventory

由于这些原因，您应该以怀疑的眼光看待库存。阅读公司报告或浏览互联网，以确定公司库存的情况

### Prepaid Liabilities

[Prepaid expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prepaidexpense.asp)—which represent advance payments made by a company for goods and services to be received in the future—are considered current assets. Although they cannot be converted into cash, they are payments already made. These payments [free up capital for other uses](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100715/does-working-capital-include-prepaid-expenses.asp). Prepaid expenses might include payments to insurance companies or contractors.

预付费用——代表公司为未来收到的商品和服务支付的预付款——被视为流动资产。虽然它们不能兑换成现金，但它们是已经支付的款项。这些付款可以释放资本用于其他用途。预付费用可能包括支付给保险公司或承包商的费用。



### Formula for Current Assets ###

The total current assets formulation is a simple summation of all the assets that can be converted to cash within one year.

```
Current Assets = C + CE + I + AR + MS + PE + OLA
where:
C = Cash
CE = Cash Equivalents
I = Inventory
AR = Accounts Receivable
MS = Marketable Securities
PE = Prepaid Expenses

```



### Understanding Current Liabilities ###

Accounts payable is typically one of the largest current liability accounts on a company’s financial statements, and it represents unpaid supplier invoices. Companies try to match payment dates so that their accounts receivable are collected before the accounts payable are due to suppliers.

**应付账款**通常是公司财务报表中**最大**的流动**负债账户**之一，它代表未付的供应商发票。公司试图匹配付款日期，以便在应付给供应商的应付账款之前收回应收账款。

For example, a company might have 60-day terms for money owed to their supplier, which results in requiring their customers to pay within a 30-day term. Current liabilities can also be settled by creating a new current liability, such as a new short-term debt obligation.

例如，一家公司可能有 60 天的欠供应商付款期限，这会导致要求其客户在 30 天的期限内付款。流动负债也可以通过创建新的流动负债来解决，例如新的短期债务。

* Accounts payable
* [Short-term debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorttermdebt.asp) such as bank loans(/ loʊnz / 贷款) or commercial(/ kəˈmɜːrʃ(ə)l / 商业的，商务的) paper issued to fund operations
* [Current maturities of long-term debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentportionlongtermdebt.asp)
* Interest payable on outstanding(未支付的，未结清的) debts, including long-term obligations  未偿债务的应付利息，包括长期债务
