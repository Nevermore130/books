### Revenue 營收

若閱讀公司官方發出的財報，有時這項被稱為 Sales（銷貨、銷售額），也就是某年／季創造的收入。

Revenue is the money brought into a company from its business activities over a specified period of time, such as a quarter or year, before subtracting(/ səbˈtræktɪŋ / 减去) expenses.

收入是指在扣除费用之前，在特定时期（例如一个季度或一年）内从公司业务活动中带入公司的资金。



### Revenue Recognition Methods

### Revenues and Profit

When public companies report their [quarterly earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earningsreport.asp)（季度盈利）, two figures that receive a lot of attention are revenues and EPS. A company beating or missing analysts' revenue and earnings per share expectations(/ ˌekspekˈteɪʃ(ə)nz /  预期) can often move a stock's price.

当上市公司报告季度收益时，两个备受关注的数字是收入和每股收益。超出或低于分析师的收入和每股收益预期的公司通常会影响股价。

#### Types of Revenue ####

A company may also distinguish（/ dɪˈstɪŋɡwɪʃ / 区分） revenue between tangible(/ ˈtændʒəb(ə)l /  明确的，可感知的) and intangible product lines. For example, Apple may be interested in separately analyzing its physical products, such as the iPad, Apple Watch, and iPhone, and services such as Apple Music, Apple TV, or iCloud.

公司还可以区分有形和无形产品线的收入。例如，Apple 可能有兴趣单独分析其物理产品（例如 iPad、Apple Watch 和 iPhone）以及服务（例如 Apple Music、Apple TV 或 iCloud）。

Revenue can also be divided into [operating revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating-revenue.asp)（营业收入）—sales from a company's core business—and non-operating revenue, which is derived from secondary sources. As these non-operating revenue sources are often unpredictable or nonrecurring(nɑːnrɪˈkʌrɪŋ /  一次性，不可重现的), they can be referred to as one-time events or gains. For example, proceeds from the sale of an asset, a windfall from investments, or money awarded through litigation are non-operating revenue.

收入还可以分为营业收入（公司核心业务的销售收入）和非营业收入（来自二手来源）。 由于这些非营业收入来源通常是不可预测的或非经常性的，因此它们可以被称为一次性事件或收益。例如，出售资产的收益、投资的意外之财或通过诉讼获得的金钱都属于营业外收入。

### Formula and Calculation of Revenue ###

formula (/ ˈfɔːrmjələ /  公式，计划，方案)

The main component of revenue is the quantity（/ ˈkwɑːntəti /  数量） sold multiplied by the price. For a retailer(/ ˈriːteɪlər /), this is the number of goods sold multiplied by the sales price.

The obvious constraint with this formula is that many companies have a diversified(/ dɪˈvɜːrsɪfaɪd / 多样的) product line. For example, Apple can sell a MacBook, iPhone, and iPad, each for a different price. Therefore, the net revenue formula should be calculated for each product or service, then added together to get a company's total revenue.

收入的主要组成部分是销售数量乘以价格。对于零售商来说，这是售出的商品数量乘以销售价格。

这个公式的明显限制是许多公司拥有多元化的产品线。例如，Apple 可以以不同的价格出售 MacBook、iPhone 和 iPad。因此，应计算每种产品或服务的净收入公式，然后相加即可得出公司的总收入。

### Gains

Also called other sundry（/ ˈsʌndri / 杂项） income, gains(收益) indicate the net money made from other activities like the sale of long-term assets. These include the net income realized(实现) from one-time nonbusiness activities, such as a company selling its old transportation van, unused land, or a subsidiary（/ səbˈsɪdieri /  子公司） company.

### Primary-Activity Expenses

/ ˈpraɪmeri /

These are all expenses incurred(/ ɪnˈkɜːrd / 招致；遭受) for earning the average operating revenue linked to the primary activity of the business. They include the [cost of goods sold](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp) (COGS); [selling, general, and administrative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sga.asp) (SG&A) expenses; [depreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) or [amortization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp); and [research and development ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp)(R&D) expenses. Typical items that make up the list are:

所有这些发生的费用,是为了赚取平均收入(和主要活动相关的平均收入)

## Income Statement Structure

```
Net Income = (Revenue + Gains) - (Expenses + Losses)
```

To understand the above formula with some real numbers, let’s assume(/ əˈsuːm / 假设) that a fictitious（/ fɪkˈtɪʃəs / 虚构的） sports merchandise（/ ˈmɜːrtʃəndaɪs / 商品） business, which additionally provides training, is reporting its income statement for a recent quarter.

## Uses of Income Statements

Income statements can be used in a variety of ways. Externally, they are most commonly used by investors and creditors. Internally, they can be used by company executives（/ ɪɡˈzekjətɪvz / 高管） or management teams.

### Investors

The primary purpose of an income statement is to convey(/ kənˈveɪ / 传达) details of profitability（/ ˌprɑːfɪtəˈbɪləti /  盈利能力） and business activities of the company to the stakeholders. 

By understanding the income and expense components of the statement, an investor（/ ɪnˈvestər / ） can appreciate（/ əˈpriːʃieɪt / 理解，欣赏） what makes a company profitable.（公司的盈利能力是什么）

### Management

 how well the company’s core business is performing

Compared with the income from the sale of manufactured(/ ˌmænjəˈfæktʃər /  制品) goods, a substantially(/ səbˈstænʃəli / 大量地) high-interest income from money lying in the bank indicates that the business may not be using the available cash to its full potential by expanding the production capacity

与销售制成品的收入相比，银行存款产生的利息收入相当高，表明企业可能没有通过扩大产能来充分利用可用现金的潜力

#### What Is the Difference Between Operating Revenue and Non-Operating Revenue? ####

Operating revenue is realized through a business' primary activity, such as selling its products. Non-operating revenue comes from ancillary(/ ˈænsəleri / 辅助的) sources such as interest income from capital held(持有资本) in a bank or income from rental of business property.
