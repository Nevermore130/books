### What Is a Cash Flow Statement (CFS)? ###

A cash flow statement tracks the inflow and outflow of cash, providing insights into a company's financial health and operational efficiency.

现金流量表跟踪现金的流入和流出，提供对公司财务状况和运营效率的深入了解。

As one of the three main financial statements, the CFS complements(/ ˈkɑːmplɪments/ 补充) the balance sheet and the income statement. In this article, we’ll show you how the CFS is structured and how you can use it when analyzing a company.

作为三大主要财务报表之一，CFS 是对资产负债表和损益表的补充。在本文中，我们将向您展示 CFS 的结构以及在分析公司时如何使用它。

### How the Cash Flow Statement Is Used ###

The cash flow statement paints a picture as to how a company’s operations are running, where its money comes from, and how money is being spent. 现金流量表描绘了公司的运营情况、资金从何而来以及资金如何使用的情况。

Also known as the statement of cash flows, the CFS helps its [creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp) determine how much cash is available (referred to as [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp)) for the company to fund its operating expenses and pay down its debts. 

CFS 也称为现金流量表，帮助债权人确定有多少可用现金（称为公司为其运营费用提供资金并偿还债务）。

The CFS is equally important to investors because it tells them whether a company is on solid(/ ˈsɑːlɪd / 固体的，坚硬的；结实的) financial ground(财务基础). As such, they can use the statement to make better, more informed decisions about their investments.

CFS 对投资者同样重要，因为它告诉他们一家公司是否拥有坚实的财务基础。因此，他们可以利用该声明对其投资做出更好、更明智的决策。

### Structure of the Cash Flow Statement ###

The main components of the cash flow statement are:

1. Cash flow from operating activities
2. Cash flow from investing activities
3. Cash flow from financing activities

### Cash From Operating Activities ###

CFS include any sources and uses of cash from business activities. In other words, it reflects how much cash is generated from a company’s products or services.

These operating activities might include:

* Receipts from sales of goods and services 销售商品和服务的收入
* Interest payments 利息支付
* Income tax payments
* Payments made to suppliers of goods and services used in production 向生产中使用的商品和服务的供应商付款
* Salary and wage payments to employees
* Rent payments
* Any other type of operating expenses

### Cash From Investing Activities

include any sources and uses of cash from a company’s investments(投资)

Purchases or sales of assets, loans(/ loʊnz / 贷款) made to vendors(供应商) or received from customers, or any payments related to [mergers and acquisitions (M&A)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp) are included in this category. In short, changes in equipment, assets, or investments relate to cash from investing

资产的购买或出售、向供应商提供的贷款或从客户处收到的贷款，或与并购 (M&A) 相关的任何付款都包含在此类别中。简而言之，设备、资产或投资的变化与投资产生的现金有关

### Cash From Financing Activities

Cash from financing activities includes the sources of cash from investors and banks, as well as the way cash is paid to shareholders. This includes any dividends(/ ˈdɪvəˌdend / 股息), payments for [stock repurchases](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharerepurchase.asp), and repayment of debt principal (loans) that are made by the company.

筹资活动产生的现金包括来自投资者和银行的现金来源以及向股东支付现金的方式。这包括公司支付的任何股息、股票回购付款以及债务本金（贷款）的偿还。

Changes in cash from financing are cash-in when capital is raised and cash-out when dividends are paid. Thus, if a company issues a bond to the public, the company receives cash financing. However, when interest is paid to [bondholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondholder.asp), the company is reducing its cash. And remember, although interest is a cash-out expense, it is reported as an operating activity—not a financing activity.

融资产生的现金变化在筹集资金时为现金注入，在支付股利时为现金支出。因此，如果一家公司向公众发行债券，该公司就会获得现金融资。然而，当向债券持有人支付利息时，该公司正在减少现金。请记住，虽然利息是一项现金支出，但它被报告为经营活动，而不是融资活动。
